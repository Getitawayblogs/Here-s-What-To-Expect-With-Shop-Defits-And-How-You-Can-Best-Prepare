                    <h2>What Does Shop Defits Entail?</h2>
                    <p>A shop defit, otherwise known as a make-good or strip out, happens when a landlord or tenant requires to get the <a href="https://www.safework.nsw.gov.au/your-industry/construction/demolition">property back to its previous state</a> before the tenancy. The process involves a series of different steps involving removal and cleaning. Our team can help you map out a plan that works with your timeframe ensuring your business is ready to go by the end of your tenancy.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Detaching plumbing appliances</li>
                        <li>Elimination and/or replacement of glass and storefront</li>
                        <li>Removal of ceiling, fixtures, fittings, flooring, lighting, partitions, wall finishes, etc.</li>
                        <li>Rectification works</li>
                        <li>Painting and plastering</li>
                        <li>Final tidy</li>
                        <li>And many others</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Based on the type of project itself will determine which of these tasks will be performed. The end goal is for the store to be revived in its previous condition before the tenancy so that it can be ready for new tenants. Depending on what’s outlined in the agreement, particular tenancy and rental contracts will have specifications as to the final condition of the property by the conclusion of your tenancy.</p>
                    <h2>How You Can Prepare For A Shop Defit</h2>
                    <p>Although a shop defit might seem simple enough, you could do many other things to make it much more convenient. Depending on the type of contract you have, they have their own conditions that are based on your purpose of renting the space and the property size. In the following key points, we’re going to list out the many ways you can prepare to ease the workload of the process.</p>
                    <p><b>1. Scanning The Agreement & Being Aware Of The Conditions</b></p>
                    <p>The best way to be organised for shop defits is to make sure you thoroughly read through the contract before signing. This is to guarantee that you fully understand particular <a href="https://pp.planningportal.nsw.gov.au/development-assessment/planning-approval-pathways/complying-development/demolition">requirements</a> regarding the overall final condition of the property by the end of the tenancy. Because shopping centres have particular instructions in terms of the work hours and the level of finish required, it’s important to fill in the paperwork.</p>
                    <p>This is to ensure you know what to expect when it comes to the level of shop defits necessary. If you need more details, it’s essential to speak to the landlord before going starting the process.</p>
                    <p><b>2. Have A Checklist</b></p>
                    <p>After you’ve read the contract, you can now draft up a checklist to get all the necessary tasks done right away. Many people forget about this important step, causing great grief if you don’t have an action plan. By prioritising your tasks, you can ensure that you have the most well-planned and efficient process for the shop defits.</p>
                    <p><b>3. Speaking To A Professional</b></p>
                    <p>The last step before performing shop defits is speaking to an expert who knows what they’re doing. This is to guarantee there are no mistakes that could further delay the process or cause further issues down the track.</p>
